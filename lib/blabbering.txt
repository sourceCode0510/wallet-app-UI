so in this design we have a black background.
to card shaped parts.
and a bottom navigation bar

that's the rough idea.

let's run the default code first.
it's a really basic design perfect for beginners...

so I won't be using any images or icons of this design.
we will use the default icons provided in the flutter package.
and instead of images of people, we will use letters..

- so let's delete everything and start with scratch.

we have three screens here, even though we will implement two it's best practice to at least implement the functionality..

let's create screens.
now let's move to homescreen.

that takes care of our first screen.

now on to second..

let's access the add_new_card screen from the 'assesment' button for now and we have completed the design.


thanks for watching....
